This add-on adds tooltips to the names of CSS properties in the [Inspector's Rules view](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector#Rules_view).

It's strictly a proof of concept/demo, but it should work well enough for you to see what this feature could look like in the Firefox devtools.

To use it, you can just download the built add-on "mdn-tooltips.xpi".

Then open the Inspector, and move the mouse over a CSS property name in the Rules view. You should see the tooltip.
